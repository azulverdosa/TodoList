## General Information

This is a simple MERN application for creating todo lists. It is also an attempt for me to learn Authentiation. I used some styling scaffolding from Semantic UI to keep things clean looking, however, I don't claim to be a designer and the design is still a work in progress. I used MongoDB to store tasks and user information and learning a bit of Mongoose was an added bonus to building this project. It was working well initially, however I seem to have missed something and now it's not working the way I want it to. I am still working on it while I look at some other projects, but it is definietly not finsihed.

## Project Status

In Progress

## Room for Improvement

Improvement Thoughts:

- This was my first attempt and adding Auth to a project and it has been a bit tricky. I am going to continue working on it, but essentially this is the main theng that needs to be added
- Styling needs updating for sure.

To do:

- [ ] Add authentication
- [ ] Update styling
