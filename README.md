# MERN TODO

This is a relatively simple todo list app. The I used some styling scaffolding from Semantic UI to keep things clean looking, however, I don't claim to be a designer and the design is still a work in progress. I used MongoDB to store tasks and user information and learning a bit of Mongoose was an added bonus to building this project.

### Basic Rundown

- Home page

- Register page

![register](./UI/demo_images/Screenshot%202023-01-20%20at%202.13.44%20PM.png 'Register Page View')

- Registration is saved to MongoDB
- Loggin in brings you to Profile page
- Navigate to your Lists
- Can add/delete/edit a list and changes are saved to MongoDB
- Click on a list to see the tasks you have in those lists
- Can add/delete/edit a task and changes are saved to MongoDB

### Some details
