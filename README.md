## General Information

---

This is a simple MERN application to track user exercises. It's a helpful app for tracking (exercises or otherwise) and was intended for me to continue to work on my fullstack building. It is also an attempt for me to learn Authentiation. The I used some styling scaffolding from Semantic UI to keep things clean looking, however, I don't claim to be a designer and the design is still a work in progress. I used MongoDB to store tasks and user information and learning a bit of Mongoose was an added bonus to building this project.
